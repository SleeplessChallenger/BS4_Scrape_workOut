<h2>This repo is my attempt to learn scraping with BS4</h2>

In this repository you can find exercises that I did to get hang
of **Beautiful Soup** library.

1. the files with `basic` are the ones where I scraped not real site, but
    artificially created page
2. `real_site_scrape` is where I scraped real site
3. `imporved_real_site_scrape` is a small project where I not only scraped
    real site, but also made that info being written to `.txt`. file and present
    user the opportunity to input some basic parameters
